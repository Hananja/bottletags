- dismiss alert for config save after changing any input (see dismiss_alert.js)
- insert scanning results
- finish list view

# roles (auth system)

* administrator: everything including config
* caretaker: editor plus delete
* editor: edit tags but no config and no delete
* downloader: read only download

# Idea
cleanup after some days / allow delete for which roles?
